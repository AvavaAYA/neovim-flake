# neovim-flake

# JUST FOR TESTING NOW

Mostly based on cwfryer's [neovim-flake](https://github.com/cwfryer/neovim-flake).

Which was based on Gabriel Volpe's [neovim-flake](https://github.com/gvolpe/neovim-flake), which was based on Jordan Isaacs' [neovim-flake](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/neovim-flake), which was based on Wil Taylor's [neovim-flake](https://github.com/wiltaylor/neovim-flake).

All 4 of these are great references to see how to use a flake to build your flavor of Neovim.
The vim configuration is largely based on the oustanding [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org).
